## usePath File

The `usePath` file contains a custom React hook that monitors and manages the path or state of the bottom tab navigation within your application. This hook helps track the current tab and allows for easy navigation between tabs, ensuring that the state of the bottom tab navigation is consistently managed and accessible across different components.

### Purpose

- **State Management**: Centralizes the state management of the bottom tab navigation, making it easier to track and control the current active tab.
- **Navigation Control**: Provides a simplified API for navigating between tabs, improving the developer experience and reducing the likelihood of navigation errors.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the bottom tab navigation state is consistent and easily accessible across various parts of the application.

### Structure

The `usePath` file typically includes:

- **State Initialization**: Initializes the state for the current path or tab.
- **Effect Hooks**: Utilizes `useEffect` to monitor changes in the path and update the state accordingly.
- **Navigation Functions**: Functions to handle navigation between tabs.
- **Context**: Optionally, a context provider to share the navigation state and functions across the application.
