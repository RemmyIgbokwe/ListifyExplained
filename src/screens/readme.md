## Screens Folder

The `screens` folder contains all the individual screens of the application. Each screen represents a distinct view or page within the app, encapsulating the layout, styling, and logic needed for that specific part of the user interface.

### Purpose

- **Modularity**: Keeps the codebase modular by separating different views into individual files, making it easier to manage and develop.
- **Organization**: Organizes the project structure by grouping all screen components in one place, improving project readability and maintainability.
- **Reusability**: Allows for reusing and maintaining individual screens independently, making updates and debugging more efficient.

### Structure

The structure of the `screens` folder can vary based on the needs of the project, but typically it includes files for each screen component. You may also organize screens into subfolders if you have a large number of screens or logical groupings.
