## Constants Folder

The `constants` folder contains all the constant values used throughout the application. These constants include static values that do not change, such as configuration settings, action types, URL endpoints, and any other fixed values that are used in multiple places within the codebase.

### Purpose

- **Centralization**: By centralizing all constant values in one place, it becomes easier to manage and update them when necessary. This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors caused by hardcoding values in multiple locations.
- **Readability**: Using named constants instead of magic numbers or strings enhances the readability and understanding of the code. It makes the purpose of each value clear and the code more self-documenting.
- **Maintainability**: When constant values need to be changed, they can be updated in a single location without the need to search through the entire codebase. This improves maintainability and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs.
