## BottomSheetContext

The `BottomSheetContext` is a React context that provides a way to manage and control the display of a bottom sheet component across your application. The bottom sheet is a UI pattern used to present content that slides up from the bottom of the screen, often used for displaying additional options, menus, or detailed information without navigating away from the current view.

### Purpose

- **Centralized Control**: By using a context, the visibility and content of the bottom sheet can be controlled from any component within the provider’s tree, enabling a more flexible and centralized way to manage the bottom sheet state.
- **State Management**: It simplifies state management related to the bottom sheet, making it easy to open, close, and customize the bottom sheet’s content from different parts of the application.
- **Reusability**: The context makes the bottom sheet component reusable, as it can be easily triggered and populated with different content based on the current context or application state.

### Structure

Typically, the `BottomSheetContext` includes:

- **Context Definition**: The React context and provider that manage the state of the bottom sheet (e.g., visibility, content).
- **Provider Component**: A component that wraps parts of the application where the bottom sheet functionality is needed, providing the context to its children.
- **Hook**: A custom hook to consume the context, providing an easy-to-use interface for other components to interact with the bottom sheet.
