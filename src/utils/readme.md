The `path.tsx` file contains utility functions related to parsing and manipulating SVG paths. These functions are used to calculate the center point of a path's x-coordinate, which can be useful for positioning elements along the path.

### Purpose

- **Path Parsing**: Uses the `react-native-redash` library to parse SVG path data and extract relevant information about the path's curves.
- **Center Point Calculation**: Calculates the center point of the x-coordinate of a path, which can be used for positioning elements or determining alignment along the path.
