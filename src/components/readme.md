## Components Folder

The `components` folder contains reusable UI components that are utilized throughout the application. Each component is designed to be modular, encapsulating its own structure, styles, and behavior, making it easy to maintain and test.

### Purpose

- **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency.
- **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained, which means it can be developed, tested, and debugged independently of the rest of the application.
- **Maintainability**: By organizing the UI elements into discrete components, the codebase becomes more manageable and easier to navigate.

### Structure

Typically, each component in this folder includes:

- **Component File**: The main file that defines the component's structure and behavior (e.g., `MyComponent.jsx` or `MyComponent.js`).
- **Styles**: Optional CSS or styling files specific to the component (e.g., `MyComponent.css` or `MyComponent.module.css`).
- **Tests**: Optional test files to ensure the component works as expected (e.g., `MyComponent.test.js`).

### Usage

To use a component from the `components` folder, simply import it into your desired file:

```javascript
import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <MyComponent />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```
