## testData Folder

The `testData` folder contains sample data sets and mock data used for testing purposes throughout the application. This data is essential for ensuring that various components and functions operate correctly under different conditions without relying on live data, which can be unpredictable and difficult to control.

### Purpose

- **Consistency**: Provides consistent data sets for testing, ensuring that tests are reliable and repeatable. This helps in identifying issues that are not related to data variability.
- **Isolation**: Allows tests to run in isolation from external data sources, reducing dependencies and making tests faster and more stable.
- **Versatility**: Facilitates the testing of edge cases and error conditions by providing a controlled set of data that can include a wide range of scenarios.

### Structure

The structure of the `testData` folder can vary based on the needs of the project, but typically it includes files such as:

- **Sample Data**: JSON or other structured files containing mock data sets for various components or functions.
- **Mock Responses**: Files that simulate API responses, allowing for testing without making actual network requests.
- **Edge Case Data**: Specific data sets designed to test edge cases and error conditions.
